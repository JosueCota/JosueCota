<p align="justify">
  I've completed my bachelors in computer science at CSUF. Going forward, I am mainly interested in web development and app development but willing to do anything related to software engineering. On my off time, I like to play video games, read, and explore the robotics field. Currently eagerly seeking opportunities to further my career as a software engineer!
